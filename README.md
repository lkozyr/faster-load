## FasterLoad app

Just playing with preloading data based on mouse proximity (before the data is actually requested by user). This approach can be used to optimize performance in cases where heavy pieces of data are often requested by users.
Also using 'un-blur' image loading effect similar to one used on [Medium](https://medium.com/).

Project bootstrapped using [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app)
